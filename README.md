# Avenue-Segment-Assessments-on-Roads
Road Lane Line Detection using OpenCV | A Python project that detects lane lines in videos using Canny Edge Detection and Hough Line Transform. 🚀

# 🏙️ Avenue Segment Assessments on Roads  

This project analyzes road lane segments using **computer vision techniques** to detect lane lines, measure road conditions, and assess segment quality.  

🚀 **Key Features:**  
✅ **Lane Detection** using Canny Edge Detection & Hough Transform  
✅ **Road Condition Analysis** with Region of Interest Masking  
✅ **Frame-by-Frame Video Processing** using OpenCV  
✅ **Customizable Parameters** for better accuracy

## 🚀 How to Run  
1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rohithdannana156/Avenue-Segment-Assessments-on-Roads.git

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the lane detection script:
python "Source Code.py"

🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ Reads video footage from the /videos directory.
2️⃣ Applies Canny Edge Detection to identify lane edges.
3️⃣ Uses Region of Interest Masking to focus only on road lanes.
4️⃣ Detects lanes using Hough Line Transformation.
5️⃣ Overlays detected lane lines on the video for visualization.

🏗️ Future Enhancements
🔹 Support for real-time video analysis
🔹 Better lane detection algorithms using Deep Learning
🔹 Integration with GPS data for road segment mapping
